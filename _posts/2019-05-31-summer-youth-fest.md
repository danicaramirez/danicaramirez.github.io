the Summer Youth Fest and Arts Exhibit 2019 to cap off its celebration. With the theme, "TIWI YOUTH: Celebrating Arts and Talents, Strengthening Coastal and Marine 
Advocacy", the event took place last May 31, 2019 at Coastal and Fisheries Learning Resource Center, Watch station, Baybay, Tiwi, Albay. It was a one-day activity 
composed of mangrove planting, team building and mural painting. The event gathered 50 participants /youth artists.
