Highlighting the importance of protecting the coastal environment against garbage and other causes of pollution, the Youth Environment Leaders League (YELL) had undertaken a clean-up drive last May 4, 2019 at Baybay, Tiwi, Albay. The said activity coincides with the Ocean Month celebration held every month of May. 

With the theme, "TIWI Youth: Taking the Lead for Coastal and Marine Protection", the clean-up drive covered the whole coastline of barangay Baybay.
Results aim to heighten awareness and inform the public on better waste-management practices.The activity collected 15 sacks of garbage with the help of 70 residents, youth volunteers, Sangguniang Kabataan and barangay officials of Baybay. Among the identified items collected were diapers, cigarette butts, plastic bottles, plastic caps, food wrappers, plastic grocery bags, plastic lids, and straws/stirrer.

The organization hopes this effort will serve as a reminder to the residents to give their utmost care and protection to our coastal and marine resources.
“Our appeal to residents is to always clean their surroundings and dispose solid waste properly to reduce amount of wastes ending up in water bodies and waterways,” said Leonila V. Coralde, Municipal Agriculture Office.

The Municipal Emergency Responders Team (MERT) of LGU-Tiwi also attended and assisted in the event.As compared to other clean up drives, the organizers launched team building activities this year for the youth. The youth volunteers actively took part in the amazing race. After the event, YELL expressed their sincere appreciation to the LGU-TIWI, PGPC and ASCODE for their unwavering support.
